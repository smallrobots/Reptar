Lego Mindostorms Ev3 R3PTAR robot program. Roam, chase, bite!

This is a C# R3PTAR Program that let  Ev3 R3PTAR robot roam, find and chase the IR Beacon… and when it’s close enough give it three rapid bites :-) !

You can compile the C# code I propose in this page using Xamarin Studio 5.10.1 (Build 6), with Mono 4.2.1 as active runtime and the Monobrick Firmware Library 1.2.0.39486 to let it work on board the Lego Mindstorms Ev3 with the Monobrick firmware.

The source code is happily shared under the Code Project Open Licence (CPOL) 1.02.
